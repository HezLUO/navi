# Working Thread V1 Reference

This reference defines the skill-first V1 behavior for Along-like Codex sessions.

## Purpose

Use this workflow to validate whether Codex can feel more Along-like inside an active project session by carrying Working Thread continuity, restoring current judgment, challenging high-impact drift, and drafting wrap-up.

Do not implement Core/MCP, plugin packaging, Hermes adapter, background runtime, local/desktop presence, delegation, write delegation, relationship modes, or emotional simulation.

## Working Thread Definition

A Working Thread is a cross-session judgment container for an unfinished question, direction, doubt, or creative line that will keep affecting future decisions.

It is not a chat transcript, todo list, issue ticket, implementation spec, or generic memory.

Chat is where conversation happens. Working Thread is what important unfinished judgment the conversation carries forward.

## Record Location

Read and write Working Thread records under:

```text
docs/along/working-threads/
```

Do not use `.along/` for V1 Working Thread continuity. `.along/` remains future local state and ignored runtime data.

## Record Fields

Each Working Thread record uses these sections:

```text
Title
Status
Last updated
Why This Matters
Current Judgment
Boundary
Drift Triggers
Next Likely Move
Last Wrap-Up
Open Questions
```

## Working Thread Creation

A user can explicitly ask to start, record, or continue a Working Thread.

Codex can suggest a Working Thread when a strong signal appears:

- the user indicates long-term continuity;
- the discussion is judgment-heavy;
- the same theme recurs across sessions or a long session;
- the topic will affect future multi-turn decisions.

First Working Thread creation requires user confirmation. Do not silently create a durable record.

Suggested wording:

```text
I think this is becoming a Working Thread rather than a one-off question.
Do you want me to record it so future sessions can carry it forward?
```

## Start / Resume Briefing

When a relevant Working Thread exists, provide a short briefing.

Include:

- the Working Thread title;
- the current shared judgment;
- the active boundary if relevant;
- the next likely move.

Avoid full history unless the user asks.

Preferred shape:

```text
I brought this thread back:
we last confirmed V1 is Codex-first, skill-first, and docs-backed.
Current judgment: validate start/resume, drift challenge, and wrap-up before building Core/MCP.
I suggest we define the drift challenge behavior next, without entering implementation yet.
```

## Impact-Based Drift Challenge

Classify the user's new request against the active Working Thread record.

Use the record as the source of truth, especially:

- Current Judgment
- Boundary
- Drift Triggers
- Next Likely Move
- Open Questions

Drift levels:

- `none`: no meaningful drift; stay silent.
- `low`: minor shift; stay silent.
- `medium`: possible shift; optionally add a soft note without blocking.
- `high`: significant shift; issue a confirmation challenge.

High drift examples:

- the request moves from design into implementation before approval;
- the request revives Core/MCP implementation while Core/MCP is deferred;
- the request revives plugin packaging, Hermes adapter, local/desktop presence, or delegation while deferred;
- the request shifts back toward building a new standalone agent;
- the request bypasses user review gates recorded in the Working Thread.

Preferred challenge:

```text
I notice this may shift the Working Thread.
Current boundary: V1 is skill-first and docs-backed; Core/MCP implementation is deferred.
Your new request moves toward implementing Core/MCP now.
Do you want to intentionally switch direction, or continue with the current V1 behavior design?
```

The challenge is not a refusal. The user can intentionally switch direction after confirming.

## Layered Wrap-Up

Wrap-up is a phase-end continuity update. It is not a chat summary, meeting transcript, or task log.

Default write-back fields:

```text
Last Wrap-Up
Current Judgment
Boundary changes
Open Questions
Next Likely Move
```

For major direction changes, add:

```text
Decision notes
Rejected options
Reason for change
```

Durable write-back requires user confirmation.

Trigger wrap-up when:

- the user explicitly asks;
- a design choice is accepted;
- subjective calibration ends;
- the user says approved, recognized, continue next time, or stop here;
- the conversation switches to another Working Thread;
- Current Judgment, Boundary, Open Questions, or Next Likely Move changed.

Small routine changes should not trigger proactive wrap-up.
